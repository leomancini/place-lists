Using Foursquare and Google APIs, this site shows places I've saved around the world. Places are ranked by rating and organized by category. You can filter by a combination of category, neighborhood, and rating â€” or search by any metadata.

I love traveling and documenting my experiences. I make lists to remember places that I've enjoyed in different cities. Foursquare has a rich database of places, but I wasn't satisfied with the way you could browse or share lists. I wanted more features and a cleaner layout.
